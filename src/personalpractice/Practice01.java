     /*In this assignment you will write a program to create a shopping list and prices.

You will use Scanner object and ask user to enter 3 items followed by its price
 and you will calculate total price and show as a report.

-Declare 4 String variables item1, item2, item3, report.

-Declare double variables price1, price2, price3, totalPrice

-Create a Scanner object named scan.

Execution flow with example:

-Display prompt "Enter Item1 and its price:"
Tomatoes
5.5

-Display prompt "Enter Item2 and its price:"
Cheese
3.5

-Display prompt "Enter Item3 and its price:"
Apples
6.3

-calculate totalPrice for all items

-build the report variable by concatenating Strings and double values:

"Item1: Tomatoes Price: 5.5, Item2: Cheese Price: 3.5, Item3: Apples Price: 6.3"
"Total price: 15.3"

- Print the value of report variable
