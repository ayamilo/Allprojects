    /*LinkedList VS ArrayList
	Internally
		ArrayList is backed by array
		LinkedList is backed by Node
		Node : an object that contains value
			plus the pointer to its neighbour
	getting random item by index
			ArrayList is better
	adding removing items
			LinkedList is better
Big O(read as oh) Notation :
	this is a way programmers describe
	the performance of an algorithm
	time complexity
	O(1) means the more elements you have
	in the list , it does not change
	the performance
	O(N) means the more elements you have
	in the list , it takes more time
	performance-wise*/
